# Memory Game Project

This is a simple memory matching game built from some simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is my submission for project two of the Udacity front-end Nanodegree!
Much thanks to Udacity for providing the core HTML and CSS for the project.

# How to play

Click two cards
If it matches, nice guess. If not, remember where that card was placed
match all eight pairs before you run out of moves!
